	<h2>Biography:</h2>
	<p>
	My name is Junaid Ajibola, a Biochemistry graduate from the Federal University of Technology, Akure. Hailing from Ogun State, I currently resides in my home state and work as a Quality Control Officer at a chemical production company. With a sharp eye for detail and a passion for maintaining high standards, I ensure the quality and safety of products within the company.

Beyond my professional life, I have a strong love for football and is an avid supporter of Chelsea FC. My interests extend into the world of technology, where I am eager to pivot my career toward cloud engineering. With a growing fascination for tech and its potential, I am actively working on building the skills and knowledge necessary for a successful transition into the field, aiming to combine my problem-solving abilities with my passion for innovation.

	<!-- Why I joined Altschool -->
	<h2>Why I Joined:</h2>
	<p>
	 Altschool Africa and opportunities like the Bybit Scholarship. I was drawn to the possibilities that cloud computing offers, how it underpins the services we rely on daily, from storing our photos to running global businesses. Cloud engineering isn’t just about code; it’s about enabling innovation at scale. That’s the kind of challenge that excites me. However, I know that to truly excel in cloud engineering, I need structured learning, mentorship, and hands-on experience. That’s why I’ve chosen to study at Altschool Africa. Their practical approach, real- world projects, and community-driven model speak directly to my learning style. It’s more than a school, it’s a launchpad for people like me who are hungry to grow, switch careers, and make a difference. But growth often comes with challenges. Beyond the financial aspect, being a Bybit Scholar would mean joining a network of passionate learners and future leaders in tech. That community matters. I believe in learning not just from books or code, but from people—those ahead of me, those beside me, and those coming after. I want to be part of a movement that reshapes how African youth see education, opportunity, and technology.

	<!-- Goals for SOE Program -->
	<h2>Goals:</h2>
	<p>
	My goal is to use the skills I gain in cloud engineering to solve real-world problems. From building scalable health tech platforms, to supporting small businesses with secure and reliable infrastructure, I see cloud engineering as a way to bridge gaps and create impact. My background in science gives me a unique perspective, and I plan to bring that into every line of code I write and every solution I build.
